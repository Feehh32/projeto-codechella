## Detalhes do projeto

The project was made to be responsive and to adhere to current market practices, that's why I used the mobile-first approach. I tried to keep as much semantic code as my current knowledge allows. The entire form was validated in javascript, and the final ticket is dynamic and filled with user information. Doing this project was quite revealing, it showed me a lot of my deficiencies, but also a lot of my learning so far. I intend to continue moving forward in search of learning more and getting my first opportunity in the technology field. Now onto my first framework, because doing this entire project without one was painful haha.
